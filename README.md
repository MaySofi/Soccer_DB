Soccer DB Project

Goals: change the way the international soccer association keeps information. We want to bring the fans closer to the Club than ever before.
Fans can buy tickets, watch information that is updated by the teams and the organization (referees). 
 
There are three types of users that use the system:
Stuff - 	stuff members can track their salary and managers and owners can track stuff’s and players’ salary, team’s performance and results and schedule.

Fan - 		A fan can follow his team and league and see information about them.
					He can also purchase a ticket and get details about the fan organizations and number of fans in games.

Referee -	A referee, representing FIFA, can update game results and dates, setting future games and giving yellow and red cards to players and update it in the database.
					He can also see information about the league, teams, players and even the stuff that take a part in the games.
